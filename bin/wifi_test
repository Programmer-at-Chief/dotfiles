I have this script to login to a authentication network , can you turn this into a bash script ?

Certainly! Here's a bash script version of your Python script that logs in to the authentication network. Note that in a bash script, you wonâ€™t be able to perform browser automation (like Selenium does), but you can use curl to interact with the network's login page if the network uses HTTP forms. Below is an example that would mimic the behavior of your Python script using bash and curl:

#!/bin/bash

# Wifi credentials
username="$Wifi_user"
password="$Wifi_pass"

# URL to the captive portal (replace with actual URL if different)
URL="http://captive.apple.com"

# Get the redirect link (simulating the part that gets the link in Python)
link=$(curl -s "$URL" | grep -oP 'http[^"]+' | head -n 1)

if [[ -z "$link" ]]; then
    echo "Already logged in or no redirect URL found"
else
    echo "Redirecting to $link"
    # Simulate the login form submission using curl
    curl -s -X POST "$link" \
        -d "ft_un=$username" \
        -d "ft_pd=$password" \
        -d "button=Submit" \
        -c cookies.txt
    
    echo "Authenticated"
fi

How this works:

    Captive Portal Request: The script uses curl to request the captive portal URL (http://captive.apple.com) and parses the response using grep to extract the redirect URL (http[s]://...).
    Authentication: If the link is found, it then submits the login details (username and password) via a POST request to the form URL, using the curl command again with -d to send the form data.
    Cookies: The -c cookies.txt flag is used to store session cookies if needed for subsequent requests. You can modify this if the portal requires cookie handling.

Requirements:

    Wifi credentials: You can either set the Wifi_user and Wifi_pass environment variables or directly replace those variables in the script.
    curl: Make sure that curl is installed on your system.
    Form fields: Ensure that the form fields in the script match the actual names used by the captive portal's HTML. If they differ, adjust the -d fields accordingly.

Notes:

    This is assuming the captive portal you're working with sends an HTTP form for login. If it's more complex (JavaScript, cookies, etc.), you may need a more advanced solution, potentially using headless browsers in bash via tools like puppeteer or using Selenium with a proper Python script.

Can i use the python script in association with ping and run it as a background process to detect if there is no network and the portal page is accessible, then login automatically?
ChatGPT said:

Yes, you can use the Python script in association with ping to detect if there is no network connection and then automatically trigger the login process if the captive portal page is accessible. You can run the script as a background process and check periodically if the network is up or if the captive portal is accessible.

Here's how you can integrate the ping check with your Python script and make it run in the background:
Steps:

    Ping Check: Use ping to check if the network is available by pinging a known IP address (like Google's DNS 8.8.8.8 or another reliable host).
    Captive Portal Detection: If ping fails (indicating no network connection), check if the captive portal URL (http://captive.apple.com) is accessible. If it is, trigger the login process.
    Automatic Login: If the captive portal is accessible, run the Python login script automatically.
    Run in Background: Use nohup or a similar command to run the script in the background.

Solution Example:

    Python Script (unchanged, your original script):

#!/bin/python3
import requests
import time
try:
    from selenium import webdriver
    from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service
    from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
except:
    print("Install selenium module")
    exit()
import os

# Firefox driver path
firefox_driver_path="/usr/bin/geckodriver"
try: 
    service=Service(firefox_driver_path)
    driver= webdriver.Firefox(service=service)
except:
    print("Gecko Driver not installed!!")
    exit()

username=os.getenv("Wifi_user")
password=os.getenv("Wifi_pass")

# Check captive portal
data=requests.get("http://captive.apple.com")

for i in (data.text).split('"'):
    if "http" in i:
        link=i
        break
    else:
        link="0"

if (link != "0"):
    driver.get(link)

    user_field = driver.find_element(By.ID, "ft_un").send_keys(username)
    pass_field = driver.find_element(By.ID, "ft_pd").send_keys(password)
    button = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "input[type='submit']").click()
    print("Authenticated")
else:
    print("Already logged In")

time.sleep(1)
driver.quit()

    Bash Script: This script will check for network connectivity using ping, and if the portal is accessible, it will invoke the Python login script.

#!/bin/bash

# Wifi credentials (make sure they are set as environment variables)
username="$Wifi_user"
password="$Wifi_pass"

# Check network connectivity by pinging Google's DNS (8.8.8.8)
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 > /dev/null 2>&1

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    # No internet connection, check if the captive portal page is accessible
    echo "Network is down or captive portal might be available"
    
    # Check if the captive portal is accessible
    curl -s --head http://captive.apple.com | head -n 1 | grep "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" > /dev/null
    
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Captive portal is accessible, logging in..."
        # Run the Python login script in the background
        nohup python3 /path/to/your/script.py & # Change the path accordingly
    else
        echo "No captive portal found"
    fi
else
    echo "Network is up and running"
fi

Explanation:

    Ping Check: The ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 command checks if you can reach Google's DNS server. If the network is up, it will succeed (exit status 0); if not, it will fail (exit status 1).
    Captive Portal Check: If ping fails, the script attempts to reach the captive portal (http://captive.apple.com) using curl. It checks if the response header contains "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" to ensure the portal page is accessible.
    Python Script Execution: If the captive portal is accessible, the script runs the Python login script in the background using nohup to ensure it continues running even after the shell session ends.

Running it in the Background:

To ensure this process runs continuously (for example, checking the network status every 5 minutes), you can create a cron job or use a loop in the bash script.
Example: Running the check every 5 minutes using a loop:

You can add this part to the script so it keeps checking every 5 minutes:

while true; do
    ./your_script.sh # Replace with your actual script name
    sleep 300 # Wait for 5 minutes (300 seconds)
done

This will run indefinitely, checking the network and logging in if needed. To stop the process, you can kill it manually or control it with kill if needed.
Example: Using cron to run the check every 5 minutes:

You can edit the crontab by running crontab -e and adding:

*/5 * * * * /path/to/your/script.sh

This will run the script every 5 minutes automatically.
Conclusion:

    The bash script checks if the network is down and if the captive portal is accessible.
    If the portal is accessible, it triggers the Python login script to authenticate.
    You can run this setup as a background process using a loop or a cron job for periodic checks.

Make sure that the Python script is executable (chmod +x script.py), and that the necessary dependencies like Selenium and Firefox are installed and properly set up.
